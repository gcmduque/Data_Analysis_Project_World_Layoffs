# World Layoffs Analysis and Dashboard

### Overview
Using layoff data from different countries, this project investigates the overall state of the world's job market. More specifically, what industries and countries have the most and least layoffs through out the timeline of the avaialble data. Before arriving to making these conclusions, standard practice of data cleaning and analysis were done using MySQL and were loaded in Tableau to create chart representataions of the analysis.

### Steps
A. Data Cleaning using MySQL
- Prepare data for cleaning
- Remove duplicates
- Standardize the values
- Work with Null or blank values
- Remove unecessary rows/columns

B. Data Exploration using MySQL
- Investigate what the cleaned data tells
- Created scripts to process and extract meaningful data that supports the overall narrative of what the data is trying to show

C. Data Presentation using Tableau
- Created charts and diagrams to present the overall narative of the processed data

### Conclusion
<p align="justify">Coming from minimal layoff count in 2021, a drastic amount of 160,000 individuals were laid off the next year and another 125,000 the following year. And both of these massive layoffs were lead by consumer companies such as Meta and Google while Retail and Other industries followed. On the other hand, least affected industries were Real Estate, Travel and Hardware which may pose more resilient in the massive layoffs happening worldwide. Overall, 2022 was a pivotal year as companies started laying off workers and with 2023 not yet finished, it seems it will not be slowing down. With USA leading the world with most layoffs with 250,000 in contrast with Poland's 25 total layoffs, this analysis gave us a world perspective on what's happening in the job market and which among these countries and industries were most affected.</p>
